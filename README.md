# binder-example

This repository serves as a "binder" example. It has been outfitted with the appropriate build files so that its content can be connected with a BinderHub instance, which is [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) in this case.

A binder contains at least two things:
1. Code or content that people can run, which is "index.ipynb" in this case.
2. Configuration file for building the environment, which is "environment.yml" in this case. 

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, click on the below badge.
